brief: File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system watches selected files and triggering alerts when these files
       are modified. Specifically, these tests will check if FIM stops detecting events when deleting
       the target of a monitored 'symbolic link'.
       The FIM capability is managed by the 'wazuh-syscheckd' daemon, which checks configured files for
       changes to the checksums, permissions, and ownership.

pytest_args:
    - fim_mode:
        realtime: Enable real-time monitoring on Linux (using the 'inotify' system calls) and Windows systems.
        whodata: Implies real-time monitoring but adding the 'who-data' information.
    - tier:
        0: Only level 0 tests are performed, they check basic functionalities and are quick to perform.
        1: Only level 1 tests are performed, they check functionalities of medium complexity.
        2: Only level 2 tests are performed, they check advanced functionalities and are slow to perform.

    description: Check if the 'wazuh-syscheckd' daemon detects events properly when deleting a target of a symlink,
                 this link is updated, and the target is recreated again. For this purpose, the test will monitor a
                 'symbolic link' pointing to a file/directory, and once FIM starts, it will create and expect events
                 inside the pointed folder. After the events are processed, the test will remove the link target and
                 wait until the links are reloaded. Then, the test will create the file/directory again, generate
                 events inside the target that the link was pointing to, and check that no FIM events are triggered.
                 Finally, the test will wait until the links are reloaded, generates, and checks the FIM events
                 with the updated link.
