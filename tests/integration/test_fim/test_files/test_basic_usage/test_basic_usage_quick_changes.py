type: integration

brief: File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system watches selected files and triggering alerts when these
       files are modified. Specifically, these tests will check if FIM events of type 'added', 'modified',
       and 'deleted' are generated when the related operations are performed in specific time intervals.
       The FIM capability is managed by the 'wazuh-syscheckd' daemon, which checks configured files
       for changes to the checksums, permissions, and ownership.

pytest_args:
    - fim_mode:
        realtime: Enable real-time monitoring on Linux (using the 'inotify' system calls) and Windows systems.
        whodata: Implies real-time monitoring but adding the 'who-data' information.
    - tier:
        0: Only level 0 tests are performed, they check basic functionalities and are quick to perform.
        1: Only level 1 tests are performed, they check functionalities of medium complexity.
        2: Only level 2 tests are performed, they check advanced functionalities and are slow to perform.
