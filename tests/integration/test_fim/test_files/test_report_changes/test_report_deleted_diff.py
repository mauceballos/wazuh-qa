brief: File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system watches selected files and triggering alerts when
       these files are modified. Specifically, these tests will check if FIM manages properly
       the 'diff' folder created in the 'queue/diff/local' directory when removing a monitored
       folder or the 'report_changes' option is disabled.
       The FIM capability is managed by the 'wazuh-syscheckd' daemon, which checks configured
       files for changes to the checksums, permissions, and ownership.
