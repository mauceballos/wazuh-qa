type: integration

brief: These tests will check if the File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system does not add 'audit' rules for
       non-existing directories. The 'who-data' feature of the FIM system uses the Linux Audit subsystem
       to get the information about who made the changes in a monitored directory. These changes produce
       audit events that are processed by 'syscheck' and reported to the manager. The FIM capability
       is managed by the 'wazuh-syscheckd' daemon, which checks configured files for changes
       to the checksums, permissions, and ownership.

pytest_args:
    - fim_mode:
        realtime: Enable real-time monitoring on Linux (using the 'inotify' system calls) and Windows systems.
        whodata: Implies real-time monitoring but adding the 'who-data' information.
    - tier:
        0: Only level 0 tests are performed, they check basic functionalities and are quick to perform.
        1: Only level 1 tests are performed, they check functionalities of medium complexity.
        2: Only level 2 tests are performed, they check advanced functionalities and are slow to perform.

    description: Monitor non-existent directory with 'who-data' and check that it is added
                 to the rules after creating it. For this purpose, the test will monitor
                 a non-existing folder using 'who-data'. Once FIM starts, the test
                 will check that the audit rule is not added. Then, it will create
                 the folder and wait until the rule is added again.
                 The audit thread runs always a directory that is configured to be monitored
                 in 'who-data' mode. Does not matter if it exists at start-up or not. Once that
                 thread is up, the audit rules are reloaded every 30 seconds (not configurable),
                 so when the directory is created, it starts to be monitored.
