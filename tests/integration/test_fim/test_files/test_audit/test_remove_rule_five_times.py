type: integration

brief: These tests will check if the 'wazuh-syscheckd' and 'auditd' daemons work together properly.
       In particular, it will be verified that when the 'audit' rules of a directory monitored
       in 'who-data' mode are manipulated multiple times, they switch to being monitored in the
       'realtime' mode. The 'who-data' feature of the of the File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system uses
       the Linux Audit subsystem to get the information about who made the changes in a monitored directory.
       These changes produce audit events that are processed by 'syscheck' and reported to the manager.
       The FIM capability is managed by the 'wazuh-syscheckd' daemon, which checks configured files
       for changes to the checksums, permissions, and ownership.

pytest_args:
    - fim_mode:
        realtime: Enable real-time monitoring on Linux (using the 'inotify' system calls) and Windows systems.
        whodata: Implies real-time monitoring but adding the 'who-data' information.
    - tier:
        0: Only level 0 tests are performed, they check basic functionalities and are quick to perform.
        1: Only level 1 tests are performed, they check functionalities of medium complexity.
        2: Only level 2 tests are performed, they check advanced functionalities and are slow to perform.
