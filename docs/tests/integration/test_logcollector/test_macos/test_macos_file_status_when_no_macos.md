# Test macOS - File status when no macos
## Overview 

Checks that `wazuh-logcollector` does not store and removes, if exists, previous 
"macos"-formatted localfile data in the file_status.json

## Objective

- Confirm that, given a file_status.json that contains a valid combination of 
"settings" and "timestamp" of "macos", when starting an agent that has no 
"macos" localfile configured on its ossec.conf file, it should happen that, when
file_status.json is updated after a certain time, no "macos" status should 
remain stored on the status file.

## Expected behavior
